Final scores are a combination of your highest scoring games (Tournament registration card will outline how many, for example best 3). 1 point per kill. 1st place 15 points, 2nd place 10 points, 3rd place 9 points, 4th place 7 points, 5th place 6 points, 6th place 5 points, 7th place 4 points, 8th place 3 points, 9th place 2 points, 10th place 1 point. For Headshot Challenge games normal points rule apply, plus 1 point per headshot! In the event of a tie points situation the following will be the deciding tie break factor and in this order: kill points, whichever team has the most kills will be elevated above the other. placement points, whichever team has the most placement points will be elevated above the other. if teams have the same kills and same placement points the prize (if applicable) will be split between the tied teams. CAPTAIN SPECIAL TOURNAMENTS: In addition to the Standard Point Scoring, your Captain's kills are doubled. Your captain is the person who 'registers' your team for the tournament and therefore is the person responsible for 'inviting' the other team members. If it is a flexi-start tournament your captain will also be the person who has to press the 'start' button in order to 'start' your entry into the tournament. DATA COLLECTION: We do everything possible to collect all game data, if any is missing via the game developers API, sadly we cannot take responsibility. In order to combat this rare occurrence we encourage you to stream (ensure settings save your stream afterwards) and post your stream into our Discord\\u2019s (https://discord.gg/) #now-streaming channel at your tournament start time. This will then act as a back-up to show any missing game data. Alternatively you can email info@FLC.gg GENERAL RULES: The registered players must have at least 200 BR games played on their record to be eligible. FLC reserves the right to change this limit on a tournament by tournament basis. FLC tournaments are for players on Playstation, Xbox and PC. Flexi-start tournaments require the person, who entered the team into the tournament, to check-in by clicking your 'Start Button' in the 'My Tournament' page. Fixed time tournaments require no check-in. Jump into a lobby with your registered team and play the game mode that matches the tournament game mode. Teams are allowed to back out of games and can play as many games as they can fit into their tournament window. Final games can be started before the time is up. For example if your tournament window is 06:00 - 09:00 your last game can start at 08:59 and you can continue playing until that game ends. You can enter a tournament with a team with \\u2018less players\\u2019 than the game mode we are currently running a tournament on (duo\\u2019s, trios, quads), however, you must still play in the tournament specific game mode. For example a duo or trio can enter our \\u2018BR Quad tournament\\u2019 but you must play in \\u2018BR Quads\\u2019 with \\u2018squad fill\\u2019 turned off. Another example a solo or duo can enter our trio competition but must play \\u2018BR Trios\\u2019 with \\u2018squad fill\\u2019 turned off. No Reverse Boosting. No Aimbots. No Hacks. No Alt Accounts. No cheating. If you are found cheating you risk forfeiting your prize and being banned from future events. All players Activision accounts, under 'game data and profile privacy' must have 'game play data' set to 'ALL'. If we cannot verify your KD your score will be null & void. All results will be verified by our platform processor before final confirmation. Another manual verification will be done during beta testing before any payments are made. We will take every measure to ensure cheaters in our tournament are caught and banned, however, we cannot do anything about in-lobby cheaters during your games, so we encourage you to report the player using the in-game functions. Should you believe you have encountered someone cheating in FLC please contact us on hello@FLC.gg along with sending us (either attached or in a hosting folder) the in-game footage and we will review this. If we believe the person to be cheating their whole squad could be disqualified and/or banned from future FLC tournaments. Cash prizes become active per division upon their being 1 additional team to the number of pay-out places. For example, should pay-outs be for 1st and 2nd, we require 3 teams in a division for that division's pay-out to become active. FLC reserves the right to move teams into a different division under these circumstances and / or withhold prize money on this basis. FLC reserves the right modify or update these rules at any point in time. All decisions by W Banter Tournaments (FLC) are final. By submitting a squad and paying to enter you accept the terms above. RESTRICTED REGIONS: As per our legal obligations, FLC uses the UK Governments sanctioned nations list for regions that are not able to deposit or withdraw money at FLC (or associated companies under the All Star Gaming umbrella). Our payment partner will decline all attempted deposits from a sanctioned nation. Players from Russia or Belarus are not permitted to participate in FLC Tournaments at this time. If players from a restricted region play a free game at FLC and finish in a paid place, they will forfeit their winnings either at tournament end or at withdrawal. FLC is not allowed to send or receive money from a sanctioned nation, however, if you are a sanctioned nation national and reside in a non-sanctioned nation and have a non-sanction nation payment platform (bank, Paypal etc) then you will be able to deposit and withdraw at FLC.\"})})})]})})})})}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(TabPanel,{children:\"3\"}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(TabPanel,{children:\"4\"}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(TabPanel,{children:/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"h2\",{children:\"Any content 2\"})})]})}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(Footer,{})]});};export default FaqPage;","map":{"version":3,"names":["React","useEffect","useRef","useContext","useState","Head","Tab","Tabs","TabList","TabPanel","Footer","TestContext","AuthContext","useEffectSkipFirst","fn","arr","isFirst","current","FaqPage","testContext","authContext","CreateItemInUser","user","login","isAuthenticated","err","logout","active","setActive","e","target","value"],"sources":["/Users/samsamaei/Documents/Projects/falcon/src/Components/AdminPanel/FAQ/FaqPage.js"],"sourcesContent":["import React, { useEffect, useRef, useContext, useState } from \"react\";\nimport \"../../../Scss/Faq.scss\";\nimport Head from \"../../Items/HeaderGame\";\nimport { Tab, Tabs, TabList, TabPanel } from \"react-tabs\";\nimport \"react-tabs/style/react-tabs.css\";\nimport Footer from \"../../Firstpage/Footer.js\";\nimport TestContext from \"../../../Context/testContext\";\nimport AuthContext from \"../../../Context/Auth/authContext\";\n\nfunction useEffectSkipFirst(fn, arr) {\n  const isFirst = useRef(true);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (isFirst.current) {\n      isFirst.current = false;\n      return;\n    }\n    fn();\n  }, arr);\n}\n\nconst FaqPage = () => {\n  const testContext = useContext(TestContext);\n  const authContext = useContext(AuthContext);\n  const { CreateItemInUser } = testContext;\n  const { user, login, isAuthenticated, err, logout } = authContext;\n  const [active, setActive] = useState(1);\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"FaqPage\">\n      <Head />\n      <div className=\"secondHead\">\n        <h1>Frequently Asked Question</h1>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"MainControl\">\n        <Tabs>\n          <TabList\n            onClick={(e) => setActive(e.target.value)}\n            className=\"header\"\n          >\n            <Tab value={1} className={active == 1 ?

Another\n                          example a solo or duo can enter our trio competition\n                          but must play ‘BR Trios’ with ‘squad fill’ turned off.\n                          No Reverse Boosting. No Aimbots. No Hacks. No Alt\n                          Accounts. No cheating. If you are found cheating you\n                          risk forfeiting your prize and being banned from\n                          future events. All players Activision accounts, under\n                          'game data and profile privacy' must have 'game play\n                          data' set to 'ALL'. If we cannot verify your KD your\n                          score will be null & void. All results will be\n                          verified by our platform processor before final\n                          confirmation. Another manual verification will be done\n                          during beta testing before any payments are made. We\n                          will take every measure to ensure cheaters in our\n                          tournament are caught and banned, however, we cannot\n                          do anything about in-lobby cheaters during your games,\n                          so we encourage you to report the player using the\n                          in-game functions. Should you believe you have\n                          encountered someone cheating in FLC please contact us\n                          on hello@FLC.gg along with sending us (either attached\n                          or in a hosting folder) the in-game footage and we\n                          will review this. If we believe the person to be\n                          cheating their whole squad could be disqualified\n                          and/or banned from future FLC tournaments.

For\n                          example, should pay-outs be for 1st and 2nd, we\n                          require 3 teams in a division for that division's\n                          pay-out to become active.
